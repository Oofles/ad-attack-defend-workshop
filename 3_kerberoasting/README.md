As we have in the past two modules, we will again turn defender back on, and execute kerberaosting with a dotnet interface in a powershell one liner.  When ran in a custom runspace, this is near impossible to detect.  The hash is written to the console, not to disk, you have full control over any naming and the users targeted.
